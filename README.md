# My Libraries - A Backend Development Learning Path

This repository represents a journey through backend development, with a focus on system-level programming, algorithms, and graphics. It contains a collection of self-made libraries and tools that are used across various system-level projects.

## Core Concepts

The libraries in this repository are built from scratch to provide a deep understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science. The main areas of focus are:

*   **System-Level Programming:** Understanding how the operating system works, memory management, file I/O, and process management.
*   **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Implementing and using a variety of algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) and data structures (linked lists, hash tables, trees, etc.).
*   **Graphics:** Exploring the basics of computer graphics, from drawing pixels to creating simple graphical applications.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several sub-repositories, each with a specific purpose:

### `mylibc`

This is a C library that forms the core of this repository. It contains a wide range of functions and data structures, including:

*   **Memory Management:** Custom memory allocation and management functions.
*   **String Manipulation:** A comprehensive set of functions for string manipulation.
*   **Data Structures:** Implementations of linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, and more.
*   **Algorithms:** Various sorting and searching algorithms.
*   **File I/O:** Functions for reading from and writing to files.

### `mylibcpp`

This is a C++ library that is still under development. It is intended to be a C++ equivalent of `mylibc`, with a more object-oriented approach.

### `mylibx`

This is a graphics library for creating simple graphical applications. It is built on top of the X11 and MiniLibX libraries and provides a simple interface for drawing pixels, lines, and other shapes.

### `mytools`

This directory contains a collection of helper scripts, configuration files, and notes for development. It includes:

*   **Shell Scripts:** A variety of shell scripts for automating common tasks.
*   **Configuration Files:** Configuration files for various tools and applications.
*   **Notes:** Notes and documentation on various topics.

### `myunittest`

This is a unit testing framework for the libraries in this repository. It is used to ensure the quality and correctness of the code.

## Conclusion

This repository is a work in progress, and it is constantly being updated with new libraries, tools, and documentation. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about backend development, system-level programming, and computer science in general.
